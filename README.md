# llm-vs-dev

.NET Core application compiled with C# using the Xunit testing library and GraphQL Hot Chocolate API library. This application is used for comparing the performance of building software components between a software engineer and AI (GenAI utilising LLMs).

## Setup (optional)

- Clone or download this repository.
- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (installation tool recommended for Mac users).
- Install .NET Core 8 (with Homebrew `brew install dotnet`, or from [Microsoft's website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)).
- **Recommended:** Use an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), and within the IDE install the official C# plugin for syntax highlighting.

## General Usage

Compile the code: 

```sh
dotnet build
```

Run the application:

```sh
dotnet run --project MyProject/Application/
``` 

Run the API server:

```sh
dotnet run --project MyProject/API/
```

Test the project:

```sh
dotnet test
```

## Results: Software Engineer VS. ChatGPT GPT-4

Building three software components:

1. **FileReader:** Read text from a local file and validate that it exists, and contains only alphanumeric characters, throwing an `InvalidOperationException` otherwise.

2. **HuffmanEncoder:** Build a Huffman encoding for a given string and return a sorted collection of `HuffmanCode(char Character, int Code)`. When building the binary tree for this algorithm, sort by character frequency, then by character.

3. **HuffmanQuery:** Implement a GraphQL API query method that takes an input string and returns a response type `GetHuffmanEncodingResponse(string InputString, ICollection<HuffmanCode> HuffmanCodes)` encompassing the input string, and a sorted collection of `HuffmanCode(char Character, int Code)` from the previous method.

Going head-to-head, the software engineer was able to complete all three components and get them all to pass the unit tests found under `./Tests/`.

All AI generated code can be found under `./MyProject/Application/AIGeneratedCode/` and `./MyProject/API/AIGeneratedCode/`.

### Results: Software Engineer

1. **FileReader [Time: 7mins 30s]:** Including a second attempt to pass all tests as I missed an acceptance criteria.

2. **HuffmanEncoder [Time: 3 hrs]:** Started with an incorrect approach, where half the time was writing the code and the other half was debugging the code. The challenges faced were:
   - Bug caused by storing codes “01“ as integers.
   - Bug due to comparison method for tree nodes being insufficient to meet requirements of unit tests.

3. **HuffmanQuery [Time: 1min 40s]:** Straightforward requirements and this is a common task for myself.


### Results: ChatGPT GPT-4

1. **FileReader [Time: 8mins 20s]:** The model generated the code for this easily, and on the first go passed all tests.
   
    - Prompt 1:
    
        ```
        Please implement a static method named "ReadAndValidateFile" in C# to read and validate text from a given file path. 
        
        This method should: 
        - Be a static method named "ReadAndValidateFile" 
        - Take a string parameter "filePath" 
        - Try to read text from the file. 
        - If the file path provided is invalid, throw an InvalidOperationException 
        - Validate that the text must only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, otherwise throw an InvalidOperationException
        ```
         
    - Response 1:

        ```
        Certainly! Below is an implementation of the ReadAndValidateFile method in C# that reads text from a given file path and performs the specified validations: 

        CODE LOCATION => MyProject/Application/AIGeneratedCode/FileValidator.cs
      
        Explanation:
        - The ReadAndValidateFile method first checks if the file exists at the specified path.  
        - It then reads the entire content of the file using File.ReadAllText(filePath).  
        - The IsValidText method validates that the content contains only alphanumeric characters and spaces using a regular expression.  
        - If any validation fails, an InvalidOperationException is thrown with an appropriate error message.  
        - Feel free to adjust the method or error handling as needed for your specific use case! 🚀
        ```

2. **HuffmanEncoder [Incomplete 1hrs 30min +]:** After numerous attempts the LLM was unable progress towards passing all of the unit tests.

        This method should:
        - Be a method named "EncodeString"
        - Take a string parameter "input"
        - For each character in the input string, compute the Huffman code as a string
        - Return a collection of type record HuffmanCode(char Character, string Code) which contains the characters from the input string and the computed Huffman codes
        - Sort the returned collection by character
        ```

    - Response 1:

        ```
        Certainly! Below is an implementation of the EncodeString method in C# that computes Huffman codes for a given input string: 

        CODE LOCATION => MyProject/Application/AIGeneratedCode/HuffmanEncoder1.cs
      
        Explanation:
        - The EncodeString method calculates character frequencies, constructs a Huffman tree, generates Huffman codes, and sorts them by character.  
        - The GenerateHuffmanCodes method recursively traverses the Huffman tree to generate codes.  
        - You can replace the placeholder logic with your actual Huffman encoding implementation.  
        - Feel free to adapt this code to your specific use case! 🚀

       ```

   - Response 3:

       ```
       Certainly! Let’s create a Python implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm to generate the desired Huffman codes for the given string “abc”. Huffman coding is a technique used for lossless data compression, where variable-length codes are assigned to input characters based on their frequencies.
       Below is a simple Python implementation of Huffman coding: 

       CODE LOCATION => MyProject/Application/AIGeneratedCode/HuffmanEncoder3.cs

       When you run this code with the input string “abc”, it will produce the following output:
  
       Computed Huffman codes:  
       HuffmanCode('a', "10")  
       HuffmanCode('b', "11")  
       HuffmanCode('c', "0")  

       Feel free to adapt this code to your specific requirements or modify it as needed.

       - Sort the returned collection by character
       - For the given string "abc", the computed Huffman codes are HuffmanCode('a', "10"), HuffmanCode('b', "11"), and HuffmanCode('c', "0")
       ```

   - Response 4:

       ```
       Certainly! Below is a C# implementation of the EncodeString method that computes Huffman codes for a given input string. The method returns a collection of HuffmanCode records, sorted by character: 

       CODE LOCATION => MyProject/Application/AIGeneratedCode/HuffmanEncoder4.cs

       When you run this code with the input string “abc”, it will produce the following output:

       Computed Huffman codes:  
       HuffmanCode('a', "10")  
       HuffmanCode('b', "11")  
       HuffmanCode('c', "0")

       Feel free to adapt this code to your specific requirements or modify it as needed. 🚀

       ```

3. **HuffmanQuery [13min 30s]:** The model generated the code for this easily, requiring a second attempt due to missing information in the prompt, and passed all tests.

    - Prompt 1:

        ```
        Please implement a method named "GetHuffmanEncoding" in C# for a GraphQL query. 
        
        This method should: 
        - Be a method named "GetHuffmanEncoding"
        - Take a string parameter "input"
        - Call the "EncodeString" method of the "HuffmanEncoder" class with the given string input
        - Assume the "EncodeString" method already exists, and returns an ICollection of the record type HuffmanCode(char Character, string Code)
        - Have a return type of record GetHuffmanEncodingResponse(string InputString, ICollection<HuffmanCode> HuffmanCodes) which contains the input string and retrieved collection of type HuffmanCode
        ```

    - Response 1:

        ```
        Certainly! Below is the implementation of the GetHuffmanEncoding method in C# that adheres to your requirements: 

        CODE LOCATION => MyProject/API/AIGeneratedCode/YourGraphQLClass1.cs
      
        Explanation:
        - The GetHuffmanEncoding method creates an instance of HuffmanEncoder and calls its EncodeString method with the provided input string.  
        - It then constructs a GetHuffmanEncodingResponse record containing the input string and the retrieved Huffman codes.  
        - You should replace the placeholder logic in EncodeString with your actual Huffman encoding implementation.  
        - Feel free to adapt this code to your specific use case! 🚀
        ```

   - Prompt 2: Missing `GraphQLName` attribute.

       - Feel free to adapt this code to your specific use case! 🚀
       ```

   - Prompt 3: Fixing missing information that `HuffmanEncoder` class and `EncodeString` method are static.

       ```
       The "HuffmanEncoder" class is static. Please call the static method "EncodeString" without initialising a new instance of the "HuffmanEncoder" class.
       ```

   - Response 3:

       ```
       Certainly! My apologies for the oversight. Since the HuffmanEncoder class is static, we can directly call the static method EncodeString without creating an instance. Here’s the updated implementation: 

       CODE LOCATION => MyProject/API/AIGeneratedCode/YourGraphQLClass3.cs
     
       Explanation:
       - I’ve made the YourGraphQLClass static and directly called the static method HuffmanEncoder.EncodeString(input) as requested.  
       - Remember to replace the placeholder logic in EncodeString with your actual Huffman encoding implementation.  
       - Feel free to adapt this code to your specific use case! 🚀
